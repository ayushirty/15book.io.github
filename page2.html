    The 2011 Cricket World Cup Final was a One Day International (ODI) match played between India and Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai, 
    India on 2 April 2011, Saturday.
     The culmination of the tenth edition of the World Cup, it was the first time that two Asia teams had faced each other in World Cup final.
      India won the match by six wickets—its second World Cup win after the 1983 tournament—and became the third team to have won the title more than once, after Australia (1987, 1999, 2003, 2007 and later 2015) and the West Indies (1975 and 1979).
       India became the first country to win Cricket World Cup in their own country.

Both teams had progressed through three stages to reach the final.
 India had won all but two matches to that point, losing to South Africa and tying with England in the group stage.
  Sri Lanka had won all but one completed match, against Pakistan.

        The match formed the climax of 2016 Indian film M.S. Dhoni : The Untold Story,
         the biopic of then Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 
         The archived footages of the actual match were used and 
         the face of the lead actor was used instead of Dhoni's face.
          M.S. Dhoni was portrayed by Sushant Singh Rajput.
